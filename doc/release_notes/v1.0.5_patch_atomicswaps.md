# Releasenotes Rivine v1.0.5 Atomic Swaps Patch

This release is a patched version of the v1.0.5 release.
The main motivation for this patch was to ensure that our atomic swap feature
works without bugs, and that all atomic swap CLI commands are aligned with
the decred tools, with exceptions where logic is specific to Rivine.

As this is a patch, there is no tag that accompanies it,
you'll however find it on GitHub as <https://github.com/rivine/rivine/tree/v1.0.5-patch-atomicswap>.

## Summary

- Safe bug fixes and improvements;
- Detailed documentation about transactions;
- CLI client now exposes explorer functionality as `explore` sub commands of the CLI client;
- Atomic swap CLI client commands usage and terminology have been aligned with decred atomic swap tools;
- Atomic swap CLI client commands have received several bug fixes;

## Upgrade concerns

- `atomicswap claim` command has been renamed to `atomicswap redeem` and takes now only 2 positional arguments: `<outputid> <secret>`;
- `atomicswap audit` command has been renamed to `atomicswap auditcontract` and takes now only 1 positional argument: `<outputid>`;
- `atomicswap auditcontract` command has now flag arguments (`--secrethash`, `--amount`, `--sender`, `--min-duration`) allowing you to automatically validate certain or most properties of the found atomic swap contract, as part of printing the contract to the STDOUT;
- `atomicswap extractsecret` takes now the positional argument(s) `<transactionid> [outputid]` instead of `outputid [hashedsecret]`;
- `atomicswap extractsecret` has now a flag argument `--secrethash`, allowing you to automatically validate the extrated secret prior to returning it;
- `atomicswap refund` takes now only 1 positional argument: `<outputid>`;
- The atomic swap CLI client commands no longer support v0-transaction atomic swap contracts in any way;
